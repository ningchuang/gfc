			<p class="review"> Great people to work with. I needed flooring installed quickly due to the pending sale of a house. They were able to accommodate all my needs and had an excellent selection of in-stock carpet and vinyl to choose from within my budget. I would highly recommend using Goodman's for all your flooring needs.</p>
